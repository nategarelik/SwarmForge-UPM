## About

SwarmForge aims to streamline game development workflows by leveraging AI to assist with tasks such as generating game objects, scripts, level layouts, and more. This UPM package allows easy integration of SwarmForge into your Unity projects.

## Installation

You can install SwarmForge via the Unity Package Manager using a Git URL.

1.  Open your Unity project.
2.  Go to `Window > Package Manager`.
3.  Click the `+` icon in the top-left corner of the Package Manager window.
4.  Select `Add package from git URL`.
5.  Enter the following URL:

    ```
    https://github.com/nategarelik/SwarmForge-UPM.git#main
    ```

    *(Note: Replace `#main` with a specific version tag if you want to use a released version, e.g., `#v1.1.0`)*

6.  Click `Add`.

Unity will download and install the package.

## Usage

Once installed, you can access the SwarmForge window in the Unity Editor via `Window > SwarmForge`.

The main components of the window are:

-   **Prompt Input:** Enter your natural language requests for the AI here.
-   **AI-Generated Tasks:** This section will display the breakdown of your request into smaller, actionable tasks generated by the AI planner.
-   **Script Preview:** If the AI generates code, it will appear here for review.
-   **Log Output:** Displays communication logs with the backend orchestrator.
-   **WebSocket Status:** Indicates the connection status to the backend.
-   **Custom Modes:** Select from predefined or custom AI modes to tailor the AI's behavior.
-   **Run Mode Button:** Execute the selected custom mode.

To use SwarmForge:

1.  Ensure your SwarmForge backend services (Orchestrator and optionally MCP Docker Container) are running. See [Backend Configuration](#backend-configuration) for details.
2.  Enter your prompt in the Prompt field.
3.  Click "Send".
4.  Observe the AI-Generated Tasks and Log Output.
5.  Review any generated scripts in the Script Preview.

## Custom Modes

SwarmForge supports custom AI modes, allowing you to define specific behaviors and prompts for different types of tasks (e.g., Environment Generation, Character Creation).

Custom modes are defined in the `Editor/custom_modes.json` file within the SwarmForge package in your project's `Packages` folder.

**[Image Placeholder: Screenshot of the custom_modes.json file structure]**

You can edit this file directly to add, modify, or remove modes. Each mode has:

-   `name`: A unique name for the mode.
-   `description`: A brief explanation of what the mode does.
-   `prompt_template`: A template to format the user's input before sending it to the AI. Use `{input}` as a placeholder for the user's prompt.
-   `system_prompt`: A system-level instruction sent to the AI to guide its behavior for this mode.
-   `default_tasks`: A list of predefined tasks to display in the UI when this mode is selected.

Changes to `custom_modes.json` should be automatically picked up by the SwarmForge window.

## Backend Configuration

SwarmForge requires a running backend orchestrator service. This service communicates with AI models and performs tasks.

1.  **Clone the main SwarmForge repository:** You need the main SwarmForge project to run the backend services. Clone it from [https://github.com/nategarelik/SwarmForge](https://github.com/nategarelik/SwarmForge) (or your fork).
2.  **Set Project Path in Unity:** In the Unity Editor, go to `SwarmForge > Backend Manager`. Set the "Project Path" to the root directory of the main SwarmForge repository you cloned.

    **[Image Placeholder: Screenshot of the Backend Manager window]**

3.  **Build MCP Docker Image (Optional but Recommended):** If you plan to use agents that require the MCP Docker container, build the image once:
    ```bash
    cd [Your SwarmForge Project Path]/python/mcp
    docker build -t swarmforge-mcp .
    ```
4.  **Start Backend Services:** Use the buttons in the `SwarmForge > Backend Manager` window to start the MCP Docker Container and the Python Orchestrator.

Ensure the WebSocket status in the main SwarmForge window shows "Connected".
